/*When is a for loop better than a while loop?
For loops are used when you know the amount of times you need to loop,
which makes it more efficient than While loops because they are used to loop
until an event returns false. For loops require more steps to execute which
can make code seem more complex */

/*What is the difference between a for loop and a for...in loop?
The for loop are all about having to do with doing the same thing over and over
again that consists of three expressions (var i = 0; i < 9; i++).
The for...in loop iterates or repeats over the enumerable properties of an object.
For each distinct property, statements can be executed.*/

/*The while loop creates a loop that executes a specific statement and runs as
long as the condition remains true. The condition is evaluated before
executing the loop statement. The do...while loop creates a loop that executes
a specified statement until the condition returns false. The condition
is evaluated after executing the statement.*/
